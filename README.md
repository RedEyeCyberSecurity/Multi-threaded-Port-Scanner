# Multi-threaded-Port-Scanner
A simple, multi-threaded port scanner. This scans specified ports on a target IP address to identify open ports.

This tool uses sockets to scan ports on a remote server/IP address. It allows penetration testers and researchers to test if a service is exposed on a specific port.
